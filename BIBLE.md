# *Dungeon*'s Bible

## What is *Dungeon*?

*Dungeon* is a RPG playable in your browser.

## What's the story?

You wake up in the prison of a mysterious dungeon. Last thing you remember: somebody hit your head from behind in the woods. You must have fell unconscious. Your goal is to find the exit and get out of here. On your path, you will encounter many creatures and unforgiving traps that will prevent you from making it alive. You will also gather useful objects and find great riches that will make you wealthy if you manage to pass these terrible obstacles.

## What inspired you?

Old games such as Eye of the Beholder, Lands of Lore, Diablo, and Baldur's Gate. And, of course, Dungeons & Dragons.

## How does it work?

Very much like in the RPGs above, you will create your own character by choosing a race and a class. Depending on the kind of adventure you want to play, you can impersonate for example a dwarven fighter or an elven wizard.

The game itself is centered around the map of the dungeon that you draw as you explore its levels. You can enter rooms, fight monsters, pick up loot, and solve puzzles that involve locked doors and hidden levers.

## How do I win?

To win the game, you must find the exit of the dungeon and gather as much gold as you. Sounds easy, right?
